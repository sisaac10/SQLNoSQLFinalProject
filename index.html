  <p>This website was created to present my work related to my Final Project for I590 SQL NoSQL class 
  taught by Professor Ying Ding at Indiana University. The presentation of this work is strictly for academic purposes</p>
  <br />
  <p>This project is based on the evaluation of data related to the three different datasets. I created three XML pages</p>
  <p>to present the data for you to review. You can click on the links below to view the XML pages.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://sisaac10.github.io/startersite/happiness.xml">2016 World Happiness Report</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sisaac10.github.io/startersite/edexpense.xml">World Education Expenditure</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sisaac10.github.io/startersite/highered.xml">Times World University Ranking</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I created three collections in mongodb to store and query the data.</p>
