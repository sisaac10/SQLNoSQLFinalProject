  <p>This website was created to present my work related to my Final Project for I590 SQL NoSQL class 
  taught by Professor Ying Ding at Indiana University. The presentation of this work is strictly for academic purposes</p>
  <br />
  <p>This project is based on the evaluation of data related to the three different datasets:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://sisaac10.github.io/startersite/happiness.xml">2016 World Happiness Report</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sisaac10.github.io/startersite/edexpense.xml">World Education Expenditure</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sisaac10.github.io/startersite/highered.xml">Times World University Ranking</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I created two different NoSQL databases, mongodb and XML, to store and query the data.</p>
